# 【TCSVT'25】WaveGuard: Robust Deepfake Detection and Source Tracing via Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet and Graph Neural Networks

## ⭐ Abstract


Deepfake technology has great potential in media and entertainment, but it also poses serious risks, including privacy leakage and identity fraud. To address these threats, proactive watermarking methods have emerged by embedding invisible signals for active protection. However, existing approaches are often vulnerable to watermark destruction under malicious distortions, leading to insufficient robustness. Moreover, strong embedding may degrade image quality, making it difficult to balance robustness and imperceptibility.

To solve these problems, we propose WaveGuard, a proactive watermarking framework that explores frequency-domain embedding and graph-based structural consistency optimization. Watermarks are embedded into high-frequency sub-bands using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to enhance robustness against distortions and deepfake forgeries. By leveraging joint sub-band correlations, WaveGuard supports robust extraction for source tracing and semi-robust extraction for deepfake detection. We also employ dense connectivity strategies for feature reuse and propose a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to reduce perceptual artifacts and improve visual quality. Additionally, a Tanh-based Spatial Embedding Attention Module (TSEAM) refines both global and local features, improving watermark concealment without sacrificing robustness.

The figure shows the comparison of three watermarking embedding strategies: the first two are based on GAN and VAE to optimize the image quality, while WaveGuard introduces GNN structural consistency constraints to enhance invisibility and robustness.

## 📁 Dataset Preparation

WaveGuard was trained and tested in CelebA-HQ. We don't own data sets, they can be downloaded from the official website.

- <a href="https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html" style="color:#0078d4;">Download CelebA-HQ</a>

This project uses the CelebA-HQ dataset with 128×128 and 256×256 resolutions. Please organize images as follows:

```
CelebA-HQ
├── train
│   ├── 000001.jpg
│   ├── 000002.jpg
│   └── ...
├── val
│   └── ...
└── test
    └── ...
```
Ensure all images are cropped and resized appropriately before training.

## 🎛️ Noise Layers

Since we don't own the source code, we recommend downloading and placing the model source code and weights by yourself. The source code can be found at the following links:

- [SimSwap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06340)
- [GANimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09251)
- [StarGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00699)

These modules simulate various deepfake attacks and are used to evaluate the robustness and traceability of our watermarking system under adversarial scenarios.


## 🔧 Training Command

We employ a progressive training strategy. The model is trained in multiple stages, where the training configuration and loss weights can be gradually adjusted based on the checkpoint obtained from the previous stage. This enables progressive optimization of the model throughout the training process.

```bash
python main.py

## 🧪 Test Command

```python
python test.py
```
